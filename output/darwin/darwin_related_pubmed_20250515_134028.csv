10.1126/science.adj4478,Ecological speciation in Darwin's finches: Ghosts of finches future.,Jeffrey Podos; Katie M Schroeder,2024-10-11,Science,"The theory of ecological speciation posits that adaptive divergence among incipient species raises incidental barriers to reproduction, thus catalyzing the emergence of new species. In this study, we conducted an experimental test of this theory in Galápagos finches, a clade in which beaks and mating songs are mechanistically linked. We forecasted the acoustic structure of songs for a set of possible evolutionary futures (successive droughts spurring increasingly large beaks) and, in a field assay, presented resulting song simulations to territorial males. We found that responses to songs dropped off after six simulated drought events, to degrees roughly comparable to drops in response to songs that diverged through cultural drift and acoustic adaptation. Our results support, in Darwin's finches, the feasibility and mechanistic bases of an ecological speciation hypothesis.",39388551,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39388551/,,,,

Using whole-genome data of 3955 of Darwin's finches on the Galápagos Island of Daphne Major, we identified six loci of large effect that explain 45% of the variation in the highly heritable beak size of Geospiza fortis, a key ecological trait. The major locus is a supergene comprising four genes. Abrupt changes in allele frequencies at the loci accompanied a strong change in beak size caused by natural selection during a drought. A gradual change in Geospiza scandens occurred across 30 years as a result of introgressive hybridization with G. fortis. This study shows how a few loci with large effect on a fitness-related trait contribute to the genetic potential for rapid adaptive radiation.",37769091,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37769091/,,,,

The drivers of adaptive radiation have often been conceptualized through the concept of ""adaptive landscapes,"" yet formal empirical estimates of adaptive landscapes for natural adaptive radiations have proven elusive. Here, we use a 17-year dataset of Darwin's ground finches (Geospiza spp.) at an intensively studied site on Santa Cruz (Galápagos) to estimate individual apparent lifespan in relation to beak traits. We use these estimates to model a multi-species fitness landscape, which we also convert to a formal adaptive landscape. We then assess the correspondence between estimated fitness peaks and observed phenotypes for each of five phenotypic modes (G. fuliginosa, G. fortis [small and large morphotypes], G. magnirostris, and G. scandens). The fitness and adaptive landscapes show 5 and 4 peaks, respectively, and, as expected, the adaptive landscape was smoother than the fitness landscape. Each of the five phenotypic modes appeared reasonably close to the corresponding fitness peak, yet interesting deviations were also documented and examined. By estimating adaptive landscapes in an ongoing adaptive radiation, our study demonstrates their utility as a quantitative tool for exploring and predicting adaptive radiation.",37671423,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37671423/,,,,

However, the extent to which divergent and/or transgressive gene expression changes are involved in speciation is not well studied. In this study, we employ comparative transcriptomics to investigate gene expression changes associated with the origin and evolution of two homoploid hybrid plant species, Argyranthemum sundingii and A. lemsii (Asteraceae). As there is no standard methodology for comparative transcriptomics, we examined five different pipelines for data assembly and analysing gene expression across the four species (two hybrid and two parental). We note biases and problems with all pipelines, and the approach used affected the biological interpretation of the data. Using the approach that we found to be optimal, we identify transcripts showing DE between the parental taxa and between the homoploid hybrid species and their parents; in several cases, putative functions of these DE transcripts have a plausible role in ecological adaptation and could be the cause or consequence of ecological speciation. Although independently derived, the homoploid hybrid species have converged on similar expression phenotypes, likely due to adaptation to similar habitats.",37477910,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37477910/,PMC10542503,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10542503/,,

Here, invasive plants are threatening the remnants of the unique cloud forest and its iconic Darwin's finches. We posit that food web disturbances caused by invasive Rubus niveus (blackberry), have contributed to the rapid decline of the insectivourous green warbler finch (Certhidae olivacea). We compared the birds' dietary changes in long-term management, short-term management and unmanaged areas. We measured C:N ratios, and δ15N‑nitrogen and δ13C‑carbon values in both consumer tissues (bird-blood) and food sources (arthropods), as indicators of resource use change, and collected mass abundance, and arthropod diversity data. We characterised the birds' diets using isotope mixing models. The results revealed that finches in (blackberry-invaded) unmanaged areas foraged more on abundant, yet lower quality, arthropods present in the invaded understory. This suggests that blackberry encroachment leads to a decrease in food source quality with physiological consequences for green warbler finch chicks. Results also implied that blackberry control has a short-term impact on food source quantity, which led to a decrease in chick recruitment that we observed in our previous studies; despite this, in the long-term, these managed systems show signs of recovery within three years of restoration.",37364830,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37364830/,,,,
10.1093/evolut/qpad072,Transgressive segregation in mating traits drives hybrid speciation.,Kotaro Kagawa; Gaku Takimoto; Ole Seehausen,2023-06-29,Evolution; international journal of organic evolution,"Hybridization can rapidly generate novel genetic variation, which can promote ecological speciation by creating novel adaptive phenotypes. However, it remains unclear how hybridization, creating novel mating phenotypes (e.g., mating season, genitalia shapes, sexual displays, mate preferences), affects speciation especially when the phenotypes do not confer adaptive advantages. Here, based on individual-based evolutionary simulations, we propose that transgressive segregation of mating traits can drive incipient hybrid speciation. Simulations demonstrated that incipient hybrid speciation occurred most frequently when the hybrid population received moderate continued immigration from parental lineages causing recurrent episodes of hybridization. Recurrent hybridization constantly generated genetic variation, which promoted the rapid stochastic evolution of mating phenotypes in a hybrid population. The stochastic evolution continued until a novel mating phenotype came to dominate the hybrid population, which reproductively isolates the hybrid population from parental lineages. However, too frequent hybridization rather hindered the evolution of reproductive isolation by inflating the variation of mating phenotypes to produce phenotypes allowing mating with parental lineages. Simulations also revealed conditions for the long-term persistence of hybrid species after their incipient emergence. Our results suggest that recurrent transgressive segregation of mating phenotypes can offer a plausible explanation for hybrid speciation and radiations that involved little adaptive ecological divergence.",37094817,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37094817/,,,,

Although developmental biologists have had great success in identifying the developmental mechanisms and molecular processes that specify organ size and shape within species, only relatively recently have the molecular tools become available to study how variation in these mechanisms gives rise to the phenotypic differences that are observed among closely related species. In addition to these technological advances, researchers interested in understanding how molecular variation gives rise to phenotypic variation have used three primary strategies to identify the molecular differences underlying species-specific traits: the candidate gene approach, differential gene expression screens, and between-species genetic mapping experiments. In this review, we discuss how these approaches have been successful in identifying the genes and the cellular mechanisms by which they specify variation in one of the most recognizable examples of the evolution of organ size, the adaptive variation in beak morphology among Darwin's finches. We also discuss insect reproductive structures as a model with great potential to advance our understanding of the specification and evolution of organ size and shape differences among species. The results from these two examples, and those from other species, show that species-specific variation in organ size and shape typically evolves via changes in the timing, location, and amount of gene/protein expression that act on tissue growth processes.",36373649,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36373649/,,,,

Here, we utilize the strength of Darwin's finches, a system synonymous with evolutionary studies, for investigating ERV history, revealing recent retrovirus-host interactions in natural populations. By mapping ERV variation across all species of Darwin's finches and comparing with outgroup species, we highlight geographical and historical patterns of retrovirus-host occurrence, utilizing the system for evaluating the extent and timing of retroviral activity in hosts undergoing adaptive radiation and colonization of new environments. We find shared ERVs among all samples indicating retrovirus-host associations pre-dating host speciation, as well as considerable ERV variation across populations of the entire Darwin's finches' radiation. Unexpected ERV variation in finch species on different islands suggests historical changes in gene flow and selection. Non-random distribution of ERVs along and between chromosomes, and across finch species, suggests association between ERV accumulation and the rapid speciation of Darwin's finches.",36229469,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36229469/,PMC9562234,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9562234/,,

In ecology and evolution, such terroir (i.e., the effect of space or ""site"") is expected to play an important role in shaping phenotypic traits. Just how important is the pure spatial effect of terroir (e.g., differences between sites that persist across years) in comparison to temporal variation (e.g., differences between years that persist across sites), and the interaction between space and time (e.g., differences between sites change across years)? We answer this question by analyzing beak and body traits of 4388 medium ground finches (Geospiza fortis) collected across 10 years at three locations in Galápagos. Analyses of variance indicated that phenotypic variation was mostly explained by site for beak size (η 2 = 0.42) and body size (η 2 = 0.43), with a smaller contribution for beak shape (η 2 = 0.05) and body shape (η 2 = 0.12), but still higher compared to year and site-by-year effects. As such, the effect of terroir seems to be very strong in Darwin's finches, notwithstanding the oft-emphasized interannual variation. However, these results changed dramatically when we excluded data from Daphne Major, indicating that the strong effect of terroir was mostly driven by that particular population. These phenotypic results were largely paralleled in analyses of environmental variables (rainfall and vegetation indices) expected to shape terroir in this system. These findings affirm the evolutionary importance of terroir, while also revealing its dependence on other factors, such as geographical isolation.",36225827,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36225827/,PMC9534727,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9534727/,,

Comparing the cellular response of different hosts to infection can provide insight into mechanisms of host defence. Here, we used RNA-seq to characterize the transcriptomic response of Darwin's finches to avian poxvirus, a disease of concern in the Galápagos Islands. We tested whether gene expression differs between infected and uninfected birds, and whether transcriptomic differences were related either to known antiviral mechanisms and/or the co-option of the host cellular environment by the virus. We compared two species, the medium ground finch (Geospiza fortis) and the vegetarian finch (Platyspiza crassirostris), to determine whether endemic Galápagos species differ in their response to pox. We found that medium ground finches had a strong transcriptomic response to infection, upregulating genes involved in the innate immune response including interferon production, inflammation, and other immune signalling pathways. In contrast, vegetarian finches had a more limited response, and some changes in this species were consistent with viral manipulation of the host's cellular function and metabolism. Many of the transcriptomic changes mirrored responses documented in model and in vitro studies of poxviruses. Our results thus indicate that many pathways of host defence against poxviruses are conserved among vertebrates and present even in hosts without a long evolutionary history with the virus. At the same time, the differences we observed between closely related species suggests that some endemic species of Galápagos finch could be more susceptible to avian pox than others.",36086992,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36086992/,,,,

It is generally held that evolution depends on the natural selection of heritable phenotypic variations originating from the genetic mutations. However, it is now increasingly evident that epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of phenotypic variation can also guide evolutionary change. Several studies have shown that the bone morphogenetic protein BMP4 is a major driver of beak morphology. A recent study explored variability of the morphological, genetic, and epigenetic differences in the adjacent ""urban"" and ""rural"" populations of two species of Darwin's finches on the Galápagos Islands and revealed significant changes in methylation patterns in several genes including those involved in the BMP/TGFß pathway in the sperm DNA compared to erythrocyte DNA. These observations indicated that epigenetic changes caused by environmental fluctuations can be passed on to the offspring. Nonetheless, the mechanism by which dysregulated expression of BMP4 impacts beak morphology remains poorly understood. Here, we show that BMP4 is an intrinsically disordered protein and present a causal a link between epigenetic changes, BMP4 dysregulation and the evolution of the beak of the finch by natural selection.",35931296,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35931296/,,,,

At the intra-specific level, it allows the analysis of the evolutionary forces at work: mutation, genetic drift, migration and selection. Moreover, because of the short evolutionary time, it is easier to identify the genetic basis of observed phenotypic differences. Most studies focus on current populations but more and more analyses are performed on ancient DNA. This provides important information for tracing the history of populations and also allows the reconstruction of phenotypes of individuals that disappeared several thousand years ago. In this short review, I present studies showing how pre-zygotic or post-zygotic barriers involved in species formation are set up using the example of the geographical barrier due to the formation of the Isthmus of Panama and that of the heterochromatin divergence in Drosophilidae. I also describe the different approaches that have been used to identify the genetic basis of well known phenotypic variations: candidate gene approach (about melanism in felines), QTL mapping (variation in the number of lateral bone plates in sticklebacks), association study (pigmentation in the Asian ladybird).

Admixture mapping for beak and body size in the small, medium, and large ground finches revealed 28 loci showing strong genetic differentiation. These loci represent ancestral haplotype blocks with origins predating speciation events during the Darwin's finch radiation.

Darwin's finches are a classic model system for ecological and evolutionary studies, yet their spatial ecology remains poorly studied. We tagged and radio-tracked five (three females, two males) medium ground finches (Geospiza fortis) to examine the feasibility of telemetry for understanding their movement and habitat use. Based on 143 locations collected during a 3-week period, we analyzed for the first time home-range size and habitat selection patterns of finches at El Garrapatero, an arid coastal ecosystem on Santa Cruz Island (Galápagos). The average 95% home range and 50% core area for G. fortis in the breeding season was 20.54 ha ± 4.04 ha SE and 4.03 ha ± 1.11 ha SE, respectively. For most of the finches, their home range covered a diverse set of habitats. Three finches positively selected the dry-forest habitat, while the other habitats seemed to be either negatively selected or simply neglected by the finches. In addition, we noted a communal roosting behavior in an area close to the ocean, where the vegetation is greener and denser than the more inland dry-forest vegetation. We show that telemetry on Darwin's finches provides valuable data to understand the movement ecology of the species.

Here, we presented pastry with flavour profiles typical of human foods (oily, salty and sweet) to small ground finches (Geospiza fuliginosa) and medium ground finches (Geospiza fortis) to test if latent taste preferences might drive the selection of human foods. If human food flavours were consumed more than a neutral or bitter control only at sites with human foods, then we predicted tastes were acquired after urbanization; however, if no site differences were found then this would indicate latent taste preferences. Contrary to both predictions, we found little evidence that human food flavours were preferred compared with control flavours at any site. Instead, finches showed a weak aversion to oily foods, but only at remote (no human foods present) sites. This was further supported by behavioural responses, with beak-wiping occurring more often at remote sites after finches tasted flavours associated with human foods. Our results suggest, therefore, that while Darwin's finches regularly exposed to human foods might have acquired a tolerance to human food flavours, latent taste preferences are unlikely to have played a major role in their dietary response to increased urbanization.",35116148,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35116148/,PMC8790341,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8790341/,,

MacGillivray's prion (P. macgillivrayi), known from a single population on St Paul (Indian Ocean), has a bill width intermediate between salvini and vittata and could also be the product of interspecies introgression or hybrid speciation. Recently, another prion population phenotypically similar to macgillivrayi was discovered on Gough (Atlantic Ocean), where it breeds 3 months later than vittata. The similarity in bill width between the medium-billed birds on Gough and macgillivrayi suggest that they could be closely related. In this study, we used genetic and morphological data to infer the phylogenetic position and evolutionary history of P. macgillivrayi and the Gough medium-billed prion relative other Pachyptila taxa, to determine whether species with medium bill widths evolved through common ancestry or convergence.

Neither male age nor number of nest provisioning visits were directly associated with number of parasites.

The P. downsi genome assembly provides an important resource for studying the molecular basis of successful invasion in the Galápagos and the dynamics of its population across multiple islands. The findings of significantly changing gene families associated with insecticide resistance and immune responses highlight the need for further investigations into the role of different gene families in aiding the fly's successful invasion.

Beaks are pink or yellow, and yellow is recessive.3 Here we show that the polymorphism arose in the Galápagos half a million years ago through a mutation associated with regulatory change in the BCO2 gene and is shared by 14 descendant species. The polymorphism is probably a balanced polymorphism, maintained by ecological selection associated with survival and diet. In cactus finches, the frequency of the yellow genotype is correlated with cactus fruit abundance and greater hatching success and may be altered by introgressive hybridization.

Genomes contain signatures of past gene exchange and, in some cases, they reveal a legacy of lineages that no longer exist. But genomic data are not available for many organisms, and particularly problematic for reconstructing and interpreting evolutionary history are communities that have been depleted by extinctions. For these, morphology may substitute for genes, as exemplified by the history of Darwin's finches on the Galápagos islands of Floreana and San Cristóbal. Darwin and companions collected seven specimens of a uniquely large form of Geospiza magnirostris in 1835. The populations became extinct in the next few decades, partly due to destruction of Opuntia cactus by introduced goats, whereas Geospiza fortis has persisted to the present. We used measurements of large samples of G. fortis collected for museums in the period 1891 to 1906 to test for unusually large variances and skewed distributions of beak and body size resulting from introgression. We found strong evidence of hybridization on Floreana but not on San Cristóbal. The skew is in the direction of the absent G. magnirostris We estimate introgression influenced 6% of the frequency distribution that was eroded by selection after G. magnirostris became extinct on these islands. The genetic residuum of an extinct species in an extant one has implications for its future evolution, as well as for a conservation program of reintroductions in extinction-depleted communities.",34330836,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34330836/,PMC8346875,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8346875/,,

Anthropogenic factors can reduce the fitness of animals but may have benefits, such as consistent human food availability. Understanding anthropogenic trade-offs is critical in environments with variable levels of natural food availability, such as the Galápagos Islands, an area of rapid urbanization. For example, during dry years, the reproductive success of bird species, such as Darwin's finches, is low because reduced precipitation impacts food availability. Urban areas provide supplemental human food to finches, which could improve their reproductive success during years with low natural food availability. However, urban finches might face trade-offs, such as the incorporation of anthropogenic debris (e.g., string, plastic) into their nests, which may increase mortality. In our study, we determined the effect of urbanization on the nesting success of small ground finches (Geospiza fuliginosa; a species of Darwin's finch) during a dry year on San Cristóbal Island. We quantified nest building, egg laying and hatching, and fledging in an urban and nonurban area and characterized the anthropogenic debris in nests. We also documented mortalities including nest trash-related deaths and whether anthropogenic materials directly led to entanglement- or ingestion-related nest mortalities. Overall, urban finches built more nests, laid more eggs, and produced more fledglings than nonurban finches. However, every nest in the urban area contained anthropogenic material, which resulted in 18% nestling mortality while nonurban nests had no anthropogenic debris. Our study showed that urban living has trade-offs: urban birds have overall higher nesting success during a dry year than nonurban birds, but urban birds can suffer mortality from anthropogenic-related nest-materials. These results suggest that despite potential costs, finches benefit overall from urban living and urbanization may buffer the effects of limited resource availability in the Galápagos Islands.",34025990,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34025990/,PMC8131787,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8131787/,,

Our aim was to test whether the magnitude of contemporary behavioural response in resident birds was consistent with patterns of genetic or cultural differences between populations. We analysed genetic structure and the occurrence of song syllable types, and experimentally measured the response of resident birds to intruder bird song from different geographical origin (i.e., island) or syllable type. We discovered a weak signal of population genetic structure between Santa Cruz and Floreana Islands. Although some song syllables occurred on both islands, others were unique to each island; Santa Cruz Island males used more unique syllables than Floreana Island males. Both Santa Cruz and Floreana resident males discriminated their response towards a simulated intruder song based on the geographical origin of the intruder song, but not on the syllable type sung by the intruder.

Comparative genetic studies using embryos of Darwin's finches have shed light on the possible evolutionary processes underlying the speciation of this clade. Molecular identification of the sex of embryonic samples is important for such studies, where this information often cannot be inferred otherwise. We tested a fast and simple chicken embryo protocol to extract DNA from Darwin's finch embryos. In addition, we applied minor modifications to two of the previously reported PCR primer sets for CHD1, a gene used for sexing adult passerine birds. The sex of all 29 tested embryos of six species of Darwin's finches was determined successfully by PCR, using both primer sets. Next to embryos, hatchlings and fledglings are also impossible to distinguish visually. This extends to juveniles of sexually dimorphic species which are yet to moult in adult-like plumage and beak colouration. Furthermore, four species of Darwin's finches are monomorphic, males and females looking alike. Therefore, sex assessment in the field can be a source of error, especially with respect to juveniles and mature monomorphic birds outside of the mating season. We caught 567 juveniles and adults belonging to six species of Darwin's finches and only 44% had unambiguous sex-specific morphology. We sexed 363 birds by PCR: individuals sexed based on marginal sex specific morphological traits; and birds which were impossible to classify in the field. PCR revealed that for birds with marginal sex specific traits, sexing in the field produced a 13% error rate. This demonstrates that PCR based sexing can improve field studies on Darwin's finches, especially when individuals with unclear sex-related morphology are involved. The protocols used here provide an easy and reliable way to sex Darwin's finches throughout ontogeny, from embryos to adults.",33667220,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33667220/,PMC7935298,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7935298/,,

Although these morphological variations are assumed to be adaptive, few studies have biomechanically tested such hypotheses. Pyrenestes ostrinus (the African seedcracker finch) shows an intraspecific polymorphism in beak size and shape that is entirely diet driven and allelically determined. Three distinct morphs feed upon soft sedge seeds during times of abundance, but during lean times switch to specializing on three different species of sedge seeds that differ significantly in hardness. Here, we test the hypothesis that beak morphology is directly related to consuming seeds of different hardness. We used a novel experimental analysis to test how beak morphology affects the efficiency of cracking sedge seeds of variable hardness, observing that neither mandibular ramus width nor crushing surface morphology had significant effects on the ability to crack different seed types. It is likely that feeding performance is correlated with other aspects of beak size and shape, such as beak depth and strength, muscle force or gape. Our results highlight how even seemingly straightforward examples of adaptive selection in nature can be complex in practice.",33536307,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33536307/,,,,

Such evolutionary diversification is typically explained by adaptation to new ecological opportunities. However, the ecological diversification of Darwin's finches following their dispersal to Galápagos was not matched on the same archipelago by other lineages of colonizing land birds, which diversified very little in terms of both species number and morphology. To better understand the causes underlying the extraordinary variation in Darwin's finches, we analyze the evolutionary dynamics of speciation and trait diversification in Thraupidae, including Coerebinae (Darwin's finches and relatives) and, their closely related clade, Sporophilinae. For all traits, we observe an early pulse of speciation and morphological diversification followed by prolonged periods of slower steady-state rates of change. The primary exception is the apparent recent increase in diversification rate in Darwin's finches coupled with highly variable beak morphology, a potential key factor explaining this adaptive radiation. Our observations illustrate how the exploitation of ecological opportunity by contrasting means can produce clades with similarly high diversification rate yet strikingly different degrees of ecological and morphological differentiation.",33391699,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33391699/,PMC7771120,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7771120/,,

Island radiations can provide key insights for understanding rapid speciation, including evolutionary patterns and the processes behind them. However, lack of resolution of species relationships has historically hindered their investigation, particularly in the plant kingdom [3-5]. Here, we report a time-calibrated phylogenomic analysis based on genotyping-by-sequencing data [6] of the 15 species of Scalesia (Darwin's giant daisies), an iconic and understudied plant radiation endemic to the Galápagos Islands and considered the plant counterpart to Darwin's finches [1, 7-9]. Results support a Pliocene to early Pleistocene divergence between Scalesia and the closest South American relatives, and rapid diversification of extant Scalesia species from a common ancestor dated to the Middle Pleistocene. Major evolutionary patterns in Scalesia include the following: (1) lack of compliance with the ""progression rule"" hypothesis, in which earlier diverging lineages are expected to occupy older islands; (2) a predominance of within-island speciation over between-island speciation; and (3) repeated convergent evolution of potentially adaptive traits and habitat preferences on different islands during the course of diversification.

Central to homoploid hybrid speciation is the role of hybridisation in the establishment of reproductive isolation between the hybrid and the parental species in the early stages of speciation, when typically all species occur at least partly in sympatry. In this work we analyse genome-wide polymorphism data obtained by transcriptome sequencing of the British hybrid species Oxford ragwort (Senecio squalidus, Asteraceae), its two Italian parental species (S. aethnensis and S. chrysanthemifolius) and their naturally occurring hybrids on Mt Etna (Italy). We show that Oxford ragwort most likely originated from de novo hybridisation between its two Italian parental species whilst they were in cultivation in British gardens at the turn of the 18th century. Reproductive isolation between the new hybrid species and its parental species probably resulted from inheritance of genetic incompatibilities between the two parental species and subsequent ecological segregation - both of which have been shown in previous studies. Our results imply that S. squalidus meets the most stringent criteria set forth to identify homoploid hybrid speciation, and call attention to the creative role of hybridisation in responding to novel environmental conditions.",32911573,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32911573/,,,,

It may retard or reverse divergence of species, enable the development of novel traits, enhance the potential for future evolution by elevating levels of standing variation, create new species, and alleviate inbreeding depression in small populations. Most of what is known of contemporary hybridization in nature comes from the study of pairs of species, either coexisting in the same habitat or distributed parapatrically and separated by a hybrid zone. More rarely, three species form an interbreeding complex (triad), reported in vertebrates, insects, and plants. Often, one species acts as a genetic link or conduit for the passage of genes (alleles) between two others that rarely, if ever, hybridize. Demographic and genetic consequences are unknown. Here we report results of a long-term study of interbreeding Darwin's finches on Daphne Major island, Galápagos. Geospiza fortis acted as a conduit for the passage of genes between two others that have never been observed to interbreed on Daphne: Geospiza fuliginosa, a rare immigrant, and Geospiza scandens, a resident. Microsatellite gene flow from G. fortis into G. scandens increased in frequency during 30 y of favorable ecological conditions, resulting in genetic and morphological convergence. G. fortis, G. scandens, and the derived dihybrids and trihybrids experienced approximately equal fitness.

Why these two bird groups radiated while the remaining endemic birds in these two archipelagos exhibit relatively low diversity and disparity remains unexplained. Ecological factors have failed to provide a convincing answer to this phenomenon, and some intrinsic causes connected to craniofacial evolution have been hypothesized. The tight coevolution of the beak and the remainder of the skull in diurnal raptors and parrots suggests that integration may be the prevalent condition in landbirds (Inopinaves). This is in contrast with the archetypal relationship between beak shape and ecology in Darwin's finches and Hawaiian honeycreepers, which suggests that the beak can adapt as a distinct module in these birds. Modularity has therefore been proposed to underpin the adaptive radiation of these groups, allowing the beak to evolve more rapidly and freely in response to ecological opportunity. Here, using geometric morphometrics and phylogenetic comparative methods in a broad sample of landbird skulls, we show that craniofacial evolution in Darwin's finches and Hawaiian honeycreepers seems to be characterized by a tighter coevolution of the beak and the rest of the skull (cranial integration) than in most landbird lineages, with rapid and extreme morphological evolution of both skull regions along constrained directions of phenotypic space. These patterns are unique among landbirds, including other sympatric island radiations, and therefore counter previous hypotheses by showing that tighter cranial integration, not only modularity, can facilitate evolution along adaptive directions.",32015429,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32015429/,,,,

We used 16S rRNA Illumina sequencing of fecal samples to assess the gut microbiome composition of Darwin's finches, complemented by analyses of stable isotope values and foraging data to provide ecological context to the patterns observed. Overall bacterial composition of the gut microbiome demonstrated co-phylogeny with Floreana hosts, recapitulated the effect of habitat and diet, and showed differences across islands.

Fitness functions, which describe the relationships between trait variation and fitness, can help to illuminate how this disruptive selection leads to population differentiation. However, a single fitness function represents only a particular selection regime over a single specified time period (often a single season or a year), and therefore might not capture longer-term dynamics. Here, we build a series of annual fitness functions that quantify the relationships between phenotype and apparent survival. These functions are based on a 9-year mark-recapture dataset of over 600 medium ground finches (Geospiza fortis) within a population bimodal for beak size. We then relate changes in the shape of these functions to climate variables. We find that disruptive selection between small and large beak morphotypes, as reported previously for 2 years, is present throughout the study period, but that the intensity of this selection varies in association with the harshness of environment. In particular, we find that disruptive selection was strongest when precipitation was high during the dry season of the previous year.

On the Galapagos, humans have established a permanent presence and have altered selective pressures through influences such as invasive predators and urbanization, affecting iconic species such as Darwin's finches. Here, I ask two key questions: (a) Does antipredator behaviour (e.g., flight initiation distance - FID) change depending on whether invasive predators are historically absent, present, or eradicated? and (b) To what degree does urbanization affect antipredator behaviour? This study is one of the first to quantify antipredator behaviour in endemic species after the eradication of invasive predators. This will help to understand the consequences of invasive predator eradication and inform conservation measures. I quantified FID, an antipredator behaviour, in the small ground finch, across multiple islands in the Galapagos that varied in the presence, absence, or successful eradication of invasive predators. On islands with human populations, I quantified FID in urban and non-urban populations of finches. FID was higher on islands with invasive predators compared to islands with no predators. On islands from which invasive predators were eradicated ~11 years previously, FID was also higher than on islands with no invasive predators. Within islands that had both urban and non-urban populations of finches, FID was lower in urban finch populations, but only above a threshold human population size. FID in larger urban areas on islands with invasive predators was similar to or lower than FID on islands with no history of invasive predators. Overall, these results suggest that invasive predators can have a lasting effect on antipredator behaviour, even after eradication. Furthermore, the effect of urbanization can strongly oppose the effect of invasive predators, reducing antipredator behaviour to levels lower than found on pristine islands with no human influences. These results improve our understanding of human influences on antipredator behaviour which can help inform future conservation and management efforts on islands.",31746013,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31746013/,,,,

They comprise many species derived from one or a small number of ancestral species in a geologically short time that have diversified into a variety of ecological niches. Several authors have proposed that introgressive hybridization has been important in the generation of new morphologies and even new species, but how that happens throughout evolutionary history is not known. Interspecific gene exchange is expected to have greatest impact on variation if it occurs after species have diverged genetically and phenotypically but before genetic incompatibilities arise. We use a dated phylogeny to infer that populations of Darwin's finches in the Galápagos became more variable in morphological traits through time, consistent with the hybridization hypothesis, and then declined in variation after reaching a peak. Some species vary substantially more than others. Phylogenetic inferences of hybridization are supported by field observations of contemporary hybridization. Morphological effects of hybridization have been investigated on the small island of Daphne Major by documenting changes in hybridizing populations of Geospiza fortis and Geospiza scandens over a 30-y period. G. scandens showed more evidence of admixture than G. fortis Beaks of G. scandens became progressively blunter, and while variation in length increased, variation in depth decreased. These changes imply independent effects of introgression on 2, genetically correlated, beak dimensions.

Less vocal deviation predicted faster pairing success in both parental species. Finally, C. pauper males with normal naris size produced species-specific song, but male C. pauper with enlarged naris size had song that was indistinguishable from other tree finches. When parasites disrupt host mating signal, they may also facilitate hybridization. Here we show how parasite-induced naris enlargement affects vocal quality, resulting in blurred species mating signals.",31185871,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31185871/,PMC6571467,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6571467/,,

Island systems are especially susceptible to invasive parasites due to the lack of defence mechanisms that usually coevolve in long-standing host-parasite relationships. We test if host genetic admixture affects parasite numbers in a novel host-parasite association on the Galápagos Islands. Specifically, we compare the number of Philornis downsi in nests with offspring sired by Darwin's small tree finch (Camarhynchus parvulus), Darwin's medium tree finch (C. pauper) and hybrids of these two species. The number of P. downsi decreased with an increasing genetic admixture of the attending male, and nests of hybrid males had approximately 50% fewer parasites than C. parvulus nests, and approximately 60% fewer parasites than C. pauper nests. This finding indicates that hybridization in this system could be favoured by selection and reveal a mechanism to combat an invasive parasite.",31183118,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31183118/,PMC6502384,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6502384/,,

Comparative phylogenetic analyses have shown that unequal sex ratios are associated with the frequency of changing mates, extrapair mating (EPM), mating system and parental care, sex-specific survival, and population dynamics. Comparative demographic analyses are needed to validate the inferences, and to identify the causes and consequences of sex ratio inequalities in changing environments. We tested expected consequences of biased sex ratios in two species of Darwin's finches in the Galápagos, where annual variation in rainfall, food supply, and survival is pronounced. Environmental perturbations cause sex ratios to become strongly male-biased, and when this happens, females have increased opportunities to choose high-quality males. The choice of a mate is influenced by early experience of parental morphology (sexual imprinting), and since morphological traits are highly heritable, mate choice is expressed as a positive correlation between mates. The expected assortative mating was demonstrated when the Geospiza scandens population was strongly male-biased, and not present in the contemporary Geospiza fortis population with an equal sex ratio. Initial effects of parental imprinting were subsequently overridden by other factors when females changed mates, some repeatedly. Females of both species were more frequently polyandrous in male-biased populations, and fledged more offspring by changing mates. The ASR ratio indirectly affected the frequency of EPM (and hybridization), but this did not lead to social mate choice. The study provides a strong demonstration of how mating patterns change when environmental fluctuations lead to altered sex ratios through differential mortality.",31160459,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31160459/,PMC6589660,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6589660/,,

But before isolation is complete there is sometimes a phase of heterosis in which hybrid fitness exceeds that of the two parental species. The genetics and evolution of heterosis and postzygotic isolation have typically been studied in isolation, precluding the development of a unified theory of speciation. Here, we develop a model that incorporates both positive and negative gene interactions, and accounts for the evolution of both heterosis and postzygotic isolation. We parameterize the model with recent data on the fitness effects of 10,000 mutations in yeast, singly and in pairwise epistatic combinations. The model makes novel predictions about the types of interactions that contribute to declining hybrid fitness. We reproduce patterns familiar from earlier models of speciation (e.g. Haldane's Rule and Darwin's Corollary) and identify new mechanisms that may underlie these patterns. Our approach provides a general framework for integrating experimental data from gene interaction networks into speciation theory and makes new predictions about the genetic mechanisms of speciation.",31059513,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31059513/,PMC6502311,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6502311/,,

This is mainly because the establishment of reproductive isolation as a product of hybridization is uncommon. Additionally, many traits are underpinned by polygeny and/or incomplete dominance, where the hybrid phenotype is an additive blend of parental characteristics. Phenotypically intermediate hybrids are usually at a fitness disadvantage compared with parental species and tend to vanish through backcrossing with parental population(s). It is therefore unknown whether the additive nature of hybrid traits in itself could lead successfully to HHS. Using a multi-marker genetic data set and a meta-analysis of diet and morphology, we investigated a potential case of HHS in the prions (Pachyptila spp.), seabirds distinguished by their bills, prey choice, and timing of breeding. Using approximate Bayesian computation, we show that the medium-billed Salvin's prion (Pachyptila salvini) could be a hybrid between the narrow-billed Antarctic prion (Pachyptila desolata) and broad-billed prion (Pachyptila vittata). Remarkably, P. salvini's intermediate bill width has given it a feeding advantage with respect to the other Pachyptila species, allowing it to consume a broader range of prey, potentially increasing its fitness. Available metadata showed that P. salvini is also intermediate in breeding phenology and, with no overlap in breeding times, it is effectively reproductively isolated from either parental species through allochrony. These results provide evidence for a case of HHS in nature, and show for the first time that additivity of divergent parental traits alone can lead directly to increased hybrid fitness and reproductive isolation.",31028398,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31028398/,PMC6657733,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6657733/,,

Over the past 30 years, human presence has grown exponentially in the Galapagos Islands, which are home to endemic Darwin's finches. Consequently, humans have changed the environment and diet of Darwin's finches, which in turn, could affect their gut microbiota. In this study, we compared the gut microbiota of two species of Darwin's finches, small ground finches (Geospiza fuliginosa) and medium ground finches (Geospiza fortis), across sites with and without human presence, where finches prefer human-processed and natural food, respectively. We predicted that: (a) finch microbiota would differ between sites with and without humans due to differences in diet, and (b) gut microbiota of each finch species would be most similar where finches have the highest niche overlap (areas with humans) compared to the lowest niche overlap (areas without humans). We found that gut bacterial community structure differed across sites and host species. Gut bacterial diversity was most distinct between the two species at the site with human presence compared to the site without human presence, which contradicted our predictions. Within host species, medium ground finches had lower bacterial diversity at the site with human presence compared to the site without human presence and bacterial diversity of small ground finches did not differ between sites. Our results show that the gut microbiota of Darwin's finches is affected differently across sites with varying human presence.",31021499,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31021499/,,,,
10.1002/ece3.4558,Exploring the hybrid speciation continuum in birds.,Jente Ottenburghs,2018-12-01,Ecology and evolution,"Hybridization is increasingly recognized as a creative evolutionary force contributing to adaptation and speciation. Homoploid hybrid speciation-the process in which hybridization results in a stable, fertile, and reproductively isolated hybrid lineage where there is no change in ploidy-has been documented in several taxa. Hybridization can directly contribute to reproductive isolation or reinforce it at a later stage. Alternatively, hybridization might not be related to the evolution of reproductive isolation. To account for these different scenarios, I propose to discriminate between two types of hybrid speciation: type I where reproductive isolation is a direct consequence of hybridization and type II where it is the by-product of other processes. I illustrate the applicability of this classification scheme with avian examples. To my knowledge, seven hybrid bird species have been proposed: Italian sparrow, Audubon's warbler, Genovesa mockingbird, Hawaiian duck, red-breasted goose, golden-crowned manakin, and a recent lineage of Darwin's finches on the island of Daphne Major (""Big Bird""). All studies provide convincing evidence for hybridization, but do not always confidently discriminate between scenarios of hybrid speciation and recurrent introgressive hybridization. The build-up of reproductive isolation between the hybrid species and their parental taxa is mainly driven by premating isolation mechanisms and comparable to classical speciation events. One hybrid species can be classified as type I (""Big Bird"") while three species constitute type II hybrid species (Italian sparrow, Audubon's warbler, and golden-crowned manakin). The diversity in hybrid bird species across a range of divergence times also provides an excellent opportunity to study the evolution of hybrid genomes in terms of genome stabilization and adaptation.",30619602,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30619602/,PMC6308868,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6308868/,,

Examination of the population genetics factors of many of these organisms with modern molecular methods has expanded our understanding of their evolution. Here, I provide a perspective on how selection, gene flow, genetic drift, mutation, and inbreeding have contributed to the evolution of 6 iconic Galapagos species: flightless cormorant, pink iguana, marine iguana, Galapagos hawk, giant tortoises, and Darwin's finches. Because of the inherent biological differences among these species that have colonized the Galapagos, different population genetic factors appear to be more or less important in these different species. For example, the Galapagos provided novel environments in which strong selection took place and the Darwin's finches diversified to produce new species and the cormorant adapted to the nutrient-rich western shores of the Galapagos by losing its ability to fly and genomic data have now identified candidate genes. In both the pink iguana, which exists in one small population, and the Galapagos hawk, which has small population sizes, genetic drift has been potentially quite important. There appears to be very limited interisland gene flow in the flightless cormorant and the Galapagos hawk. On the other hand, both the marine iguana and some of the Darwin's finches appear to have significant interisland gene flow. Hybridization between species and subspecies has also introduced new adaptive variation, and in some cases, hybridization might have resulted in despeciation. Overall, new population genetics and genomics research has provided additional insight into the evolution of vertebrate species in the Galapagos.",30541084,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30541084/,,,,

Morphs breed randomly with respect to bill size, and differ in diet and feeding performance relative to seed hardness. Previous breeding experiments are consistent with the polymorphism being controlled by a single genetic factor. Here, we use genome-wide pooled sequencing to explore the underlying genetic basis of bill morphology and identify a single candidate region. Targeted resequencing reveals extensive linkage disequilibrium across a 300 Kb region containing the insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) gene, with a single 5-million-year-old haplotype associating with phenotypic dominance of the large-billed morph. We find no genetic similarities controlling bill size in the well-studied Darwin's finches (Geospiza). Our results show how a single genetic factor may control bill size and provide a foundation for future studies to examine this phenomenon within and among avian species.",30451848,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30451848/,PMC6242981,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6242981/,,

The fauna of the Galapagos Islands includes several taxa that have been focal points for evolutionary studies. Perhaps their most famous inhabitants, Darwin's finches, represent a go-to icon when thinking about how species originate and adapt to the environment. However, unlike other adaptive radiations, past morphological and molecular studies of Darwin's finches have yielded inconsistent hypotheses of species limits and phylogenetic relationships. Expecting that idiosyncrasies of prior data and analytic methods explained different proposed classifications, we were surprised to observe that three new phylogenetic hypotheses derived mostly from the same genomics data were topologically inconsistent. We found that the differences between some of these genomics trees were as great as one would expect between two random trees with the same number of taxa. Thus, the phylogeny of Darwin's finches remains unresolved, as it has for more than a century. A component of phylogenetic uncertainty comes from unclear species limits, under any species concept, in the ground finches (Geospiza) and tree finches (Camarhynchus). We suggest that past authors should have tested the species limits of Lack, rather than uncritically accepting them. In fact, the impressive amount of genomics data do not provide unambiguous hypotheses of the number of species of Geospiza or Camarhynchus, although they imply greater species diversity than Lack's taxonomy. We suggest that insufficient sampling of species populations across islands (35.6% for morphometrics and 20.4% for genomics) prevents accurate diagnoses of species limits. However, it is unknown whether samples from a greater number of islands might result in bridging differences between species, or reveal many new ones. We conclude that attempts to interpret patterns of variation among the finches under standard evolutionary paradigms have obscured some major messages, most specifically the ongoing reciprocal interactions between geographic isolation and lineage divergence, and dispersal and gene flow caused by the volatile ecological conditions in the islands. Although the finches provide textbook examples of natural selection, better understanding of species limits and a robust phylogenetic hypothesis are required to corroborate past hypotheses of speciation and adaptive radiation in the finches of the Galapagos.",30371872,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30371872/,,,,
