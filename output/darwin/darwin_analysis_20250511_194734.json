      "abstract": "Homoploid hybrid speciation in animals has been inferred frequently from patterns of variation, but few examples have withstood critical scrutiny. Here we report a directly documented example, from its origin to reproductive isolation. An immigrant Darwin's finch to Daphne Major in the Galápagos archipelago initiated a new genetic lineage by breeding with a resident finch (Geospiza fortis). Genome sequencing of the immigrant identified it as a G. conirostris male that originated on Española >100 kilometers from Daphne Major. From the second generation onward, the lineage bred endogamously and, despite intense inbreeding, was ecologically successful and showed transgressive segregation of bill morphology. This example shows that reproductive isolation, which typically develops over hundreds of generations, can be established in only three."

      "question1": "What is hybrid speciation?",
      "answer1": "Hybrid speciation is the process where interbreeding of two species may result in the formation of a new species, reproductively isolated from the parental species.",
      "question2": "What is homoploid hybrid speciation?",
      "answer2": "Homoploid hybrid speciation is hybrid speciation without chromosomal doubling.",
      "question3": "Where did the immigrant Darwin's finch originate from?",
      "answer3": "The immigrant Darwin's finch originated from Española, which is more than 100 kilometers from Daphne Major.",
      "question4": "How many generations did it take for the new lineage to show reproductive isolation?",
      "answer4": "Reproductive isolation was established in only three generations.",
      "question5": "What is the name given to the new lineage of finches?",
      "answer5": "The new lineage is referred to as the Big Bird lineage due to its large bill size.",
      "question6": "What evidence suggests that the Big Bird lineage is ecologically successful?",
      "answer6": "Despite intense inbreeding, members of the Big Bird lineage experienced high fitness, as judged by their reproductive output and high survival rates.",
      "question7": "What role does bill morphology play in the success of the Big Bird lineage?",
      "answer7": "Bill morphology is likely a key factor in the success of the Big Bird lineage, allowing them to efficiently exploit large woody fruits during dry seasons and droughts.",
      "question8": "What is the significance of the song of the Big Bird lineage?",
      "answer8": "The distinctive song of the Big Bird lineage helps them discriminate between members of their own and other species.",
      "question9": "What is the genetic basis of the founder population of the Big Bird lineage?",
      "answer9": "The founder male was identified as a G. conirostris, and genome sequencing helped establish the genetic basis of the founder population and characteristics associated with its success.",
      "question10": "How was the founder male originally misidentified?",
      "answer10": "The founder male was initially hypothesized to be a G. fortis × G. scandens hybrid, but phylogenetic analysis showed he was actually a G. conirostris.",
      "question11": "Why is the immigration of the founder male from Española notable?",
      "answer11": "Immigration from Española is notable because it is located more than 100 kilometers from Daphne Major, and a large island (Santa Cruz) lies between them.",
      "question12": "What is the inbreeding coefficient of the founder male?",
      "answer12": "The inbreeding coefficient of the founder male was 0.19.",
      "question13": "How did the inbreeding coefficient change in the F1 generation?",
      "answer13": "The inbreeding coefficient was negative in the F1 generation due to interspecies hybridization.",
      "question14": "What happened to the homozygosity levels over the generations?",
      "answer14": "Homozygosity levels gradually increased over the next five generations due to genetic drift caused by the small number of breeding pairs.",
      "question15": "What is the genome-wide average nucleotide diversity π?",
      "answer15": "The genome-wide average nucleotide diversity π declined from 0.17% in generation 1 to ~0.13% in generations 4 to 6.",
      "question16": "What is the ecological success of the Big Bird lineage attributed to?",
      "answer16": "The ecological success of the Big Bird lineage is attributed to large bill and body size and a distinctive song.",
      "question17": "How does the bill size of the Big Bird lineage compare to its parental species?",
      "answer17": "The bill size of the Big Bird lineage is larger than both parental species, with an average of 60.8% larger in generations 4 to 6.",
      "question18": "What is the significance of the ALX1 locus in the Big Bird lineage?",
      "answer18": "The ALX1 locus is significant because it is associated with bill morphology and shows an allelic series with different effects on bill shape.",
      "question19": "What is transgressive segregation?",
      "answer19": "Transgressive segregation is the production of progeny with extreme phenotypes beyond the range of those of the parents, likely caused by epistasis or combining complementary alleles at different loci.",
      "question20": "What is the trend in bill size across generations?",
      "answer20": "There is a trend of increasing bill size across generations, which is more indicative of selection than drift.",
      "question21": "What is the most important component of bill size?",
      "answer21": "The most important component of bill size is bill depth.",
      "question22": "Is there any evidence of selection on bill depth?",
      "answer22": "Yes, there is evidence of selection on bill depth, as the mean bill depth increased significantly over generations.",
      "question23": "How does body size change across generations?",
      "answer23": "Body size remains unchanged across generations.",
      "question24": "What does the morphological analysis suggest about the position of the Big Bird lineage?",
      "answer24": "The morphological analysis suggests that the Big Bird lineage occupies unoccupied morphological space among coexisting ecological competitors.",
      "question25": "What is the significance of the HMGA2 gene?",
      "answer25": "HMGA2 has a large effect on bill dimensions, which are polygenic traits influenced by other gene variants.",
      "question26": "What is the role of epistasis in the Big Bird lineage?",
      "answer26": "Epistasis is likely responsible for the transgressive segregation observed in the Big Bird lineage.",
      "question27": "What is the significance of the distinctive song of the Big Bird lineage?",
      "answer27": "The distinctive song helps the Big Bird lineage discriminate between members of their own and other species.",
      "question28": "What is the significance of the ALX1 locus in Darwin's finches?",
      "answer28": "The ALX1 locus in Darwin's finches involves an allelic series with different effects on bill morphology.",
      "question29": "What is the significance of the increase in bill depth?",
      "answer29": "The increase in bill depth is significant because it is independent of body size and suggests directional selection.",
      "question30": "What is the overall conclusion of the study?",
      "answer30": "The study provides direct documentation of homoploid hybrid speciation in Darwin's finches, from its origin to reproductive isolation."
