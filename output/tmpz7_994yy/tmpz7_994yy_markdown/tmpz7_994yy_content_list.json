While the ultimate drivers of plant extinctions are known, the proximate mechanisms at individual and population level are not. The fossil record supports climate change as the major driver until recently, with land-use change dominating in recent millennia. Climate change may regain its leading role later this century. Documented recent extinctions have been few and concentrated among narrow-range species, but population extirpations are frequent. Predictions for future extinctions often use flawed methods, but more than half of all plants could be threatened by the end of this century.

Low original abundance and/or small range size are also strongly associated with extirpations in many local studies, on a variety of spatial scales [4,36]. Recently described plant species are more likely to become extinct [37], presumably because they usually have narrower ranges and lower abundances. Habitat specialists are also more likely to suffer extirpation, particularly those specializing on habitats that have experienced major area loss [4,24,29]. More generally, habitat specificity (number of habitat types) was the only consistent predictor of extinction risk for plants and a wide range of animal groups [38].

These relate the species distribution to current climatic and other environmental parameters and then use this relationship to predict areas with suitable conditions in future. The predicted changes in habitat are used to assess extinction risk by assuming that a species becomes extinct when $100 \\%$ (or $9 5 \\%$ ) of its range became unsuitable, or by using the categories and criteria of the IUCN Red List. These models are easy to run and with adequate data can reproduce the current distributions of species, but their use for predictions has many problems [64]. Moreover, the data is inadequate for many species, including the rare species of most concern [65]. Internal cross-validation of the models using a subset of the data likely overestimates model accuracy, and using historical data to predict the present has had varied results, with a recent study underpredicting extirpations in Sweden [66].

When the only habitat of a population is entirely converted into a crop monoculture, the proximate cause of local extinction is either the conversion process or its immediate environmental consequences. However, when fragments of the habitat remain, or the entire habitat is degraded by changes to vegetation structure, or to the fire, grazing, nutrient, or hydrological regimes [3,21,40], the proximate causes are unclear and likely to vary among species.

Invasive plants can cause plot-scale extirpations, and both these and the extinction risk for species on oceanic islands are increased when the native species is phylogenetically related to the invasive alien [53]. This specificity shows that the invaders are not just passive markers of habitat degradation, but does not identify the proximate mechanisms, which might include competition, hybridization, dilution of pollination or seed dispersal services, heterospecific pollen competition, or acting as a reservoir of pests and pathogens. Introduced goats, sheep, and rabbits are a major threat to many island plants, and direct involvement in extinctions is suspected but not well documented [21,40]. Although pests and pathogens have not been cited as the major cause of any extinction, the severity of recent outbreaks, particularly of fungal pathogens in Australia [3], suggests the role of less conspicuous outbreaks in the decline of narrow-range species may have been overlooked.

Two extinctions have so far been attributed principally to climate change, as well as one to drought and seven to wildfires; both of which may have been exacerbated by climate change [21]. Globally, most plants have been exposed over recent decades to increased temperature and vapor pressure deficits, and increased seasonality in moisture availability [52]. Surveys of plant and animal species over time showed that the absolute increase in the highest temperature during the year was the climatic factor most strongly associated with local extirpations [51], but this study did not identify the proximate cause of the plant deaths. For one herbaceous species, experimental warming resulted in rapid population declines and a local extirpation by reducing fecundity and survival across multiple life stages and depleting the seed bank [34]. Land plants typically depend for initial establishment on fine-scale microhabitats, with microclimates often more or less decoupled from the macroclimate [55], which probably accounts for much of the wide variation among species in their warming responses.

In temperate floras, plants with zygomorphic flowers have higher documented extinction risks, and both biotic pollination and dioecy have been supported as risks by multiple studies (though not all) [41]. A few natural extinctions have also been reported, one attributed to a hurricane and four to volcanic eruptions [21],  but it is  not  clear how  much the vulnerability of these species to natural causes had been increased by earlier anthropogenic habitat losses.

There is a need for more fine-scale studies of the decline and extirpation of isolated populations, recording the deaths of marked individuals and the recruitment of new individuals. These can be combined with large-scale revisitation studies to scale up the conclusions. Wherever possible, postmortem examinations should be done for dead plants to determine likely causes of death. Experimental manipulations of possible drivers of individual mortality could be used more widely and, as improved data becomes available, modeling needs to become more mechanistic.

The increasing availability of genomic data for endangered plant species and populations now make it possible to investigate not only the ecological responses of different populations to drivers such as climate change, but also their potential evolutionary responses [58,59].
