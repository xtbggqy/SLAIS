Here we report a directly documented example, from its origin to reproductive isolation. An immigrant Darwin’s finch to Daphne Major in the Galápagos archipelago initiated a new genetic lineage by breeding with a resident finch (Geospiza fortis). Genome sequencing of the immigrant identified it as a G. conirostris male that originated on Española ${ > } 1 0 0$ kilometers from Daphne Major. From the second generation onward, the lineage bred endogamously and, despite intense inbreeding, was ecologically successful and showed transgressive segregation of bill morphology. This example shows that reproductive isolation, which typically develops over hundreds of generations, can be established in only three. ",

Generations 4 to 6 were derived from a single brother-sister mating in generation 3. Despite close inbreeding, members of the lineage experienced high fitness, as judged by their reproductive output and high survival (12). At maximum (in 2010), eight breeding pairs and 36 individuals were present on the island, and on our most recent visit (in 2012), there were eight breeding pairs and 23 individuals of generations 3 to 6. From observations and experiments with ground finches (12, 13), bill morphology is likely to be a key factor in the success of these birds. The ability of finches to efficiently exploit the large woody fruits of Tribulus cistoides in dry seasons, and particularly during droughts and limited food supply, is a function of bill size, especially bill depth (12). Also, finch species imprint on features of their parents early in life, and later, when choosing a mate, they discriminate between members of their own and other species on the basis of bill size and shape, as well as body size and song (13).

This represents a substantial allometric shift in the Big Bird lineage, possibly caused by natural selection. Selection is plausible because shifts in the elevations of static allometries have been produced relatively easily in a few generations of artificial selection in laboratory populations of animals (21). The pattern of change also has the characteristics of transgressive segregation (10, 22). This is the production of progeny with extreme phenotypes beyond the range of those of the parents that are likely caused by epistasis, which has been detected in other hybridizing finch species on Daphne (23), and/or by combining complementary alleles at different loci from different populations in $\\mathrm { F _ { 2 } }$ and further generations (22, 24, 25).

The most important component of bill size is bill depth, and an increase in this dimension (Fig. 3B) was noteworthy for two reasons. First, the increase was independent of body size (Fig. 3C). The genetic correlation between bill size and body size that potentially constrains independent evolution of bill size is not known. However, in G. fortis, the genetic correlation between bill depth and body mass is strongly positive $\\cdot 0 . 6 7 \\pm 0 . 1 0$ SEM) (23). Second, bill length did not change in the population (fig. S6); hence, bills became not only larger but also progressively blunter, on average, across generations (fig. S6). A possible scenario is that transgressive segregation produced genotype combinations that have been favored by natural selection, causing the shift in beak morphology.

In Darwin’s finches, a premating barrier to interbreeding is established by a difference in song and morphology (12, 13). The test of reproductive isolation requires sympatry with the parental population(s) or a surrogate experiment, for example, with finch models and/or playback of a tape-recorded song (27). The new population on Daphne is reproductively isolated from one of the parental populations, G. fortis, but whether it is reproductively isolated from the other, $G .$ conirostris on Española, is unknown because experiments have not been done there. Nevertheless, it is likely that the founder population has already become reproductively isolated from G. conirostris, as bill size has changed in relation to body size (Fig. 3A). Together, these traits are used as cues in the choice of mates, arising from cultural, nongenetic imprinting (12, 13). Of particular relevance, experiments on Daphne Major with G. scandens showed that altering bill size in relation to body size of finch models significantly reduced responses from males (28). Additionally, males of the founder population sing a different song from G. conirostris on Española and Gardner, probably as a result of imperfect copying of a Daphne Major finch by the founder after it had first learned its father’s song on Española (or Gardner) (13). Song and morphology are cues that are used in mate choice and typically result in the avoidance of interspecific mating. ",

The newly founded population of Darwin’s finches is an incipient hybrid species, reproductively isolated and ecologically segregated from coexisting finch species (Fig. 3D). The key features of success of the new lineage are reproductive isolation based on learned song and morphology, transgressive segregation producing new phenotypes, and the availability of underexploited food resources. Homoploid hybrid speciation is believed to be a generally slow process extending over hundreds of generations (29), but, as the present example shows, it can be established in only three generations.

The project was supported by the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation and the Swedish Research Council. Sequencing was performed by the SNP&SEQ Technology Platform, supported by Uppsala University and Hospital, SciLifeLab, and the Swedish Research Council. Computer resources were supplied by Uppsala Multidisciplinary Center for Advanced Computational Science (UPPMAX). We would also like to thank two anonymous reviewers for valuable comments on the paper. The Illumina reads have been submitted to the short reads archive (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra) with the accession number PRJNA392917. Raw tree files for constructing Fig. 2A and figs. S4, S5, and S7 have been submitted to the TreeBASE database with submission ID S21803 (http://purl.org/ phylo/treebase/phylows/study/TB2:S21803?format=html). P.R.G. and B.R.G. collected the material. P.R.G., B.R.G., and L.A. conceived the study. L.A. and M.T.W. led the bioinformatic analysis of data. S.L. and F.H. performed the bioinformatic analysis. P.R.G., B.R.G., S.L., and L.A. wrote the paper with input from the other authors. All authors approved the manuscript before submission. ",
